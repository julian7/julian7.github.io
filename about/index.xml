      <description>Hi, my name is Bal√°zs Nagy. My old-time nick is Julian, and I earned the surname Severn (with the abbreviation 7) back in my ZX Spectrum days. A big shootout to Andy Severn (a.k.a. &amp;amp;e7), who did amazing things back then, and has an awesome nick.
I&amp;rsquo;m an SCM Architect by trade, also software craftsmanship, devops, and distributed version control systems advocate, and part-time Rails app developer.</description>
