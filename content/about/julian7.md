Hi, my name is Bal√°zs Nagy. My old-time nick is Julian, and I earned the surname Severn (with the abbreviation *7*) back in my [ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) days. A big shootout to Andy Severn (a.k.a. &e7), who did amazing things back then, and has an awesome nick.

I'm an SCM Architect by trade, also software craftsmanship, devops, and distributed version control systems advocate, and part-time Rails app developer.
